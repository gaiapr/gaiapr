            <p>Welcome to my website! This is where I will be sharing all my work from Graphic Design 2. You can 
                visit the different projects I did throughout the term from the top menu bar. Below are small introductions
                to each project.

                <h3>Compunding Tools</h3>
            </div>

            <p>For our first project, we were tasked with developing a large-format 2D composition 
                inspired by some aspect of life under COVID-19, showing what had changed and what 
                impact it had on us. The catch, we were to only to create this poster using non-traditional 
                tools. Meaning, we were not allowed to use to softwares that is originally intended 
                for design like adobe.
                <br></br>
                I choose online shopping as my theme because Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of online shopping 
                for the past 2 years and I thought it would be a good theme to explore. I think this 
                project really opened me up to the hidden side of design. Sometimes, we can create amazing 
                designs even without softwares we are normally used to. This project was challenging, but 
                it was really fun too! To view the process and final, click here, <a href="project1.html">Compounding Tools</a>
                or you can select it from the top menu bar. I mainly got my inspiration from <a href="https://posters.calarts.edu/?y=2017">CalArts</a> for this project.

            </p>

            <div class = "head4">
                <h3>Parametrics and Generation</h3>
            </div>

            <p>For this project, we were required to create 21 sketches using a software called "<a href="https://p5js.org/">Processing</a>".
                We were to spent 30-60 mins per day on one sketch.
                <br></br>
                This was probably the most challenging project throughout this term because coding is not my
                best strenght and it got really frustrading when something went wrong. Sometimes it would take
                me hours to solve one tiny mistake and it was definely not the best experience. However,
                I am pretty satisfied with the outcomes. Head over to <a href="project2.html">Parametrics and Generation</a> to see my sketches.
            </p>



            <div class = "head5">
                <h3>Me of the Screen</h3>
            </div>

            <p> In this project we were required to "engage in self-observation and documentation as method of design-based research,
                translate personal, embodied experience into formats legible and accessible to the public,
                organize and visualize quantitative and qualitative data in a clear and compelling manner."
                <br></br>
                I enjoyed this project. I chose to observe the interaction we have with the PRESTO tap machines for GO trains and
                subways. I struggled in creating the final piece beacuse I was not sure how to equally include qualitative data and
                quantitative data because I had more quantitive data than qualitative. I also had trouble with how how I was going to organize it
                because at first I was trying to make it chaotic but ended up with a simple layout. You can find the process and final 
                here, <a href="project3.html">Me of the Screen</a> or at the top in the menu bar.
